github is a fascist dumpster that not only steals your code to train its little shitty "ai", but also openly bootlicks the worst kind of people on the planet.

host your code on forgejo now - https://forgejo.org/

fuck fascists. deleting all my code from all allounts here and never coming back, never contributing to OSS here. you're either for open source, or you help fascists with their agenda. there's no third thing, github made its choice and it chose wrong.
